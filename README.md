### jscards

These were little, physical sticky notes I wrote when I was first learning JavaScript.
They are a bit all over the place, incomprehensive and require some knowledge of JS to make sense of.
I intend to continue working on them to make them a valid resource/reference for anyone learning JS.
Also, if you use this resource, kindly counter-check with other resources, this is still a bit _raw_.
